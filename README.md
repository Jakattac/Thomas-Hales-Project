### Features left to implement

- In the future I could also provide a page of links to other historical figures and events.

## Testing

- I have tested the site through several different browsers and screen sizes to gurrantee ease of use and good UX design.
- I think that the style change of the nav bar to be stacked rather than inline when on a phone screen really helps the design and ease of use.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment
