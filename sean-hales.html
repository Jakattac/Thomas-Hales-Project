        <p>During the Irish Civil War, Tom and his brother, Se치n Hales fought on opposite sides, with Tom fighting
            against the Anglo-Irish Treaty with the Anti-Treaty IRA while Se치n joined the newly formed National Army of
            the Irish Free State.</p>
        <p>Tom Hales was elected to the anti-Treaty IRA executive in March 1922 but resigned in June over a proposal to
            prevent the Free State's first general election in June 1922. He resumed his old rank during the civil war
            as commander of Cork 3 Brigade. While he and his brother, Se치n, ended up on opposite sides of the war, the
            brothers never openly criticized one another for their rival political stances.</p>
        <p>During the Civil War in July 1922, Tom Hales took part in the raid and capture of Skibbereen Barracks and
            Ballineen by anti-Treaty forces. He was also involved in a skirmish with Free State troops at Newcestown.
            Hales was arrested in November 1922 and imprisoned first in Cork and then at the Curragh. He was released in
            December 1923 having taken part in a hunger strike for 14 days. Hales mentions in his application for a
            military pension that he was a member of the Supreme Council of the IRB at this time.</p>
        <p>In December 1922, his brother, Se치n, was assassinated by the anti-Treaty IRA in Dublin, in reprisal for the
            Free State government's execution of IRA prisoners.</p>
