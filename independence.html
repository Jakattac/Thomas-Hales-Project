        <p>Tom Hales joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913. He was a part of a group of volunteers who planned to rise up
            in Cork during the 1916 Easter Rising, however they received last minute orders to stand down. By May 1916,
            Tom Hales and his brothers, Se√°n, Bob, and William, were fighting with the IRA in West Cork during the Irish
            War of Independence.</p>
        <p>Tom Hales was involved with the Irish Volunteer movement from its inception in November 1913. Elected a
            delegate at the Volunteer national convention in the Abbey Theatre in 1915.</p>
        <p>Hale was mobilised during Easter Rising and sent a number of dispatches to Cork requesting further
            instructions. Ultimately, however, there was no uprising in Cork to match that in Dublin. The Volunteers
            gave up their arms and were later arrested. Terence MacSwiney was arrested in Hales' home on 3 May 1916, and
            Hales himself escaped and went on the run.</p>
        <p>In December 1919, he took part in an ambush against the RIC at Kilbrittain and Bandon and was involved in the
            manufacture of gunpowder for IRA munitions. By this point, he was the commander of the Third Cork Brigade of
            the IRA. On July 1920, Hales along with Harte was arrested by soldiers from the Essex Regiment. The pair
            were taken to a nearby military barracks, where they were severely beaten while being interrogated by
            officers of the regiment. However, neither Hales nor Harte gave up any information and were eventually sent
            to a military hospital to recuperate. Hales was tried and was eventually sentenced to two years' penal
            servitude, which he served in Pentonville and Dartmoor prisons in England. He was commander of the Irish
            prisoners at Pentonville but was released following a general amnesty after the Anglo-Irish Treaty in
            December 1921. According to Tom Barry, Harte suffered brain damage and went insane before dying in Broadmoor
            Hospital.</p>
